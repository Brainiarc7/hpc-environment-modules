## ILRI HPC Environment Modules

This repo contains [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net) used in
[ILRI's research computing](http://hpc.ilri.cgiar.org/) infrastructure.

For a full list of bioinformatics software see [HPC's wiki pages](http://hpc.ilri.cgiar.org/list-of-software).

### Assumptions
These modules load & unload open source bioinformatics programs installed in
`/export/apps/$SOFTWARE/$SOFTWARE_VERSION` directory.
For example: *blast v2.2.30* is installed in `/export/apps/blast/2.2.30+`
directory.
